# WNV_QTL_Resource
## Description

 This repostitory contains the workflow associated with the manuscript titled'Adaptive immune response to West Nile virus infection in the Collaborative Cross mouse model: A database of cellular phenotypes and Quantitative Trait Loci'. There are four Jupyter notebooks with step by step instructions, along with R programs that contain the code in these notebooks. These processes were used to generate all of the analyses presented in this manuscript.

## WNV_QTL_RandomWalk_Prioritization_Publication
This is the program/notebook for West Nile virus QTL mapping, haplotype grouping and gene candidate overflow. 

## WNV_ QTL_Phenotype_Clustering_Publication
This is the program/notebook for West Nile virus QTL phenotype clustering.

## WNV_QTL_Hotspots_Publication
This is the program/notebook for West Nile virus QTL hotspot analysis.

## WNV_QTL_RandomWalk_Prioritization_Publication
This is the program/notebook for West Nile virus QTL random walk gene prioritization.
